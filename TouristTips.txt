Decorative Design Patterns
They're like a Russian nesting doll.
I have no idea how it actually works but it does, that's good, amen.
Useful when:
•You have a shitton of classes
•You have a bunch of similar types - not the same, but very similar nonetheless.
--We were already doing this with inheritance, but this could result in a new class just for one more variable.
There was a weird metaphor about ice cream - even if there's four flavours, there's still a ton of combinations - vanilla, vanilla and chocolate chips, vanilla chocolate chips in a cone vs. a cup, etc, etc

Concurrency Design Patterns
These patterns are best for multithreaded design.
Not to be confused with asynchronous design under any circumstances.
