you should never return void in an async method, EXCEPT in an event handler.
keep synchronous code to a minimum in an async program to ensure you don't block yourself - that's why you write async in the first place!
end async method names with async - it's just good form. (unless, ofc, it's a method dedicated exclusively to the creation, manipulation, or combination of tasks)

of everything, *await* is what makes a method asynchronous.
